[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pjotrp/bioruby-table.png)](http://travis-ci.org/pjotrp/bioruby-table)

Tables of data are often used in bioinformatics. This biogem contains
support for reading tables and manipulation of rows and columns. In
time it should be good for big data, and support a functional style of
programming.

Note: this software is under active development!
